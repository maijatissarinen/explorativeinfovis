# What happens when sea levels rise?
## Exploratory information visualization

## Purpose
This interactive information visualization exhibits the consequence to population as sea levels continue to rise. The visualization focuses on worst case scenario, 
where global economic growth relys heavily on fossil fuels. The map visualizes the median expected annual population exposed from coastal flooding.

This project was created as part of a university course in which students will learn theory, techniques, presentation and organizational skills for creating 
explorative information visualizations. The assignment was to visualize information about among Sustainable Development goals by UN.

## Data
This project uses data obtained from two sources. The data contains information about the annula global sea levels, and the amount of people exposed to coastal flooding. 

The data containing information about sea levels is from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, more specifically the chapter on oceans, cryosphere and sea-level change. The report offers scien-
tifically validated projections of global sea-level rise based on different emission scenarios.

The data containing information indicates how many people in each country, expressed in thousands, are projected to be affected by flooding events is by the European Comission’s
Joint Research Centre (JRC). As the data contained projections only for years 2000, 2050, and 2100, the data for between years was extrapolated exponentially to achieve smoother animation, instead of precise prediction.
